# Mama's Mwiko — Restaurant Website

**Live:** https://dereckkariuki.github.io/Mama-s-Mwiko/

A fast, mobile-first marketing site for **Mama's Mwiko**, Azalea Square, General
Mathenge Drive, Nairobi. Built to turn searches and map listings into phone
calls, bookings and walk-ins.

Plain HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript — no build step, no framework, no
dependencies. Open `index.html` in a browser and it works.

## ⚠️ Read this before publishing

The site is complete and ready to deploy, but **some content is placeholder and
must be confirmed by the owner first.** Only the facts below came from the
business listing; everything else was written to fill the page.

### Placeholder — replace before going live

1. **The menu.** `menu.html` now carries the **real** sections and dishes,
   transcribed from the owner's menu images: jiko pizzas, gyros, shawarma,
   chef's specials, weekend biryanis, bites, chips and fresh juices. Two things
   are still outstanding:
   - **Prices.** Only the four jiko pizza prices are confirmed. The source
     images are 141 px wide, at which the price column is not legible — a test
     against known ground truth misread Ksh 600 as Ksh 800 — so no other price
     is printed. Higher-resolution menu images are needed.
   - A few dish names could not be read at all. A word that scans as "POUSSIN"
     recurs before Chicken, Paneer, Prawns and Muhogo; the Sunday special and
     the menu's social handle are illegible. All are omitted rather than
     guessed.
2. **Opening times.** Only the 9:30 pm close is known. The site currently claims
   **8:00 am – 9:30 pm, seven days a week**. Fix it in two places (see
   *Changing opening hours* below).
3. **Photography.** All images are hand-drawn SVG stand-ins. Real photos of the
   food and the courtyard are the single biggest conversion win on a restaurant
   site — swap them in first. **Drop them into `assets/img/photos/` using the
   filenames in that folder's README and they appear automatically**; there is
   no HTML to edit, and a missing photo just leaves the illustration in place.
4. **The "Our Story" copy** in `index.html` now describes the food that is
   actually on the menu, but it is written from the menu rather than from the
   owner. There is no invented history in it — no family story, no founding
   date — but it should still be rewritten in the owner's own words.
   Note also that **"halal" is nowhere on the site**: the menu has no pork and
   the dessert brand is named Deen Haven, but that is an inference, not a
   confirmed fact, and it is not a claim to publish on someone's behalf.
5. **The domain.** The site is published at
   `https://dereckkariuki.github.io/Mama-s-Mwiko/`. If a real domain is bought,
   see "Using a custom domain" below — the canonical, Open Graph, JSON-LD and
   sitemap URLs all have to be updated together.

No fake customer testimonials were invented. The reviews section shows only the
real aggregate (4.8 / 36) and links out to Google.

## Files

```
index.html            Home: hero, highlights, story, signature plates,
                      booking form, reviews, hours + map
menu.html             Full menu, with sticky section jump-links
assets/css/styles.css One stylesheet; design tokens at the top
assets/js/site.js     Nav, live open/closed status, booking form
assets/img/*.svg      Placeholder artwork (see above)
robots.txt            Points crawlers at the sitemap
sitemap.xml           Two URLs
.nojekyll             Stops GitHub Pages running content through Jekyll
```

## What it does

- **Live open/closed pill** — computed in **Africa/Nairobi** time, so a visitor
  in London still sees the right answer. Shows "Open now · until 9:30pm",
  "closing at 9:30pm" in the last hour, or when we next open.
- **Today's row highlighted** in the opening-hours table.
- **Booking form → WhatsApp.** No backend and no database: the form assembles a
  pre-filled message and opens `wa.me/254791755663`. Nothing is stored.
- **Sticky call bar on mobile** — Call / Menu / Directions always one thumb away.
- **SEO groundwork** — `Restaurant` JSON-LD with address, phone, hours, price
  range and the 4.8/36 aggregate rating, so Google can show the rich result;
  plus canonical, Open Graph and Twitter card tags.
- **Accessibility** — skip link, visible focus rings, labelled form fields,
  keyboard-dismissable menu, `prefers-reduced-motion` respected.
- **No third-party JavaScript.** The only external requests are Google Fonts and
  the map iframe.

## Editing

### Changing opening hours

Two places, both need updating:

1. `assets/js/site.js` — the `HOURS` object near the top. 24-hour times, `null`
   for a closed day. This drives the live status pill.
2. `index.html` — the `<table id="hoursTable">` rows, and the
   `openingHoursSpecification` block in the JSON-LD at the bottom.

### Changing the phone number

Search for `254791755663` (links) and `0791 755663` (display text) across
`index.html`, `menu.html` and `assets/js/site.js`.

### Changing colours or type

All tokens live in `:root` at the top of `assets/css/styles.css` — palette,
radii, shadows, fonts. Change them there rather than hunting through rules.

### Adding real photos

Put them in `assets/img/photos/` with these exact names — nothing else to do:

| Filename | Where | Shape |
|---|---|---|
| `hero.jpg` | Behind the headline | Landscape 16:9 |
| `story.jpg` | Beside "Coast, grill and jiko" | Portrait 4:5 |
| `jiko-pizza.jpg` | Signature plates, card 1 | Landscape 4:3 |
| `gyros.jpg` | Signature plates, card 2 | Landscape 4:3 |
| `tawa-prawns.jpg` | Signature plates, card 3 | Landscape 4:3 |

`upgradeToPhotos()` in `assets/js/site.js` probes each file and swaps it in only
once it has loaded, so the page never flashes a broken image and works fine with
photos missing. Alt text for each photo lives in the slot's `data-photo-alt`
attribute in `index.html`. See `assets/img/photos/README.md` for shooting and
sizing notes.

**Note on link previews:** `og:image` currently points at an SVG. WhatsApp,
Facebook and X will not render an SVG preview — replace it with a 1200×630
JPEG or PNG before sharing the link anywhere.

## Running locally

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

Opening `index.html` directly with `file://` also works, though the map iframe
behaves better over HTTP.

## Deploying

Deployment is automatic. `.github/workflows/pages.yml` publishes to GitHub Pages
on every push to `main`. It copies the site files into `_site/` and uploads that,
so `menu-source/` and this README are not served as part of the website.

**One-time setup, and it must be done by hand:**
https://github.com/DereckKariuki/Mama-s-Mwiko/settings/pages → Build and
deployment → Source → **GitHub Actions**. Then re-run the workflow.

This cannot be automated. `actions/configure-pages` accepts `enablement: true`
to create the Pages site through the API, but that call needs repository-admin
rights, which the workflow's `GITHUB_TOKEN` does not carry — it fails with
"Resource not accessible by integration". Until Pages is switched on, every run
stops at the Configure Pages step with "Get Pages site failed".

To deploy manually: Actions → "Deploy site to GitHub Pages" → Run workflow.

### Using a custom domain

1. Add a `CNAME` file at the repo root containing the bare domain.
2. Point the DNS at GitHub Pages.
3. Find-and-replace `https://dereckkariuki.github.io/Mama-s-Mwiko` across
   `index.html`, `menu.html`, `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt`. Those are the
   canonical, Open Graph, JSON-LD and sitemap URLs — if they point at the wrong
   host, search engines may drop the site entirely.

## Repository layout

- `index.html`, `menu.html`, `assets/` — the website
- `menu-source/` — the owner's original menu images, kept for reference and
  excluded from the published site
- `.github/workflows/pages.yml` — the deploy
